# Initial build
The initial build will cover a purely client side app, faking server calls in
order to give an indication of the final product's utility and allow the end
client to determine if this is a commercially viable proposition. As it is a
product meant for testing, it should be robust in it's error handling and
reporting, as well as give a good indication of the final product's "feel".
