# Hello, I'm Craig Fletcher.
You can call me on 07480924132, email me at <hi@leakypixel.net>, or check out what I'm getting on with at [leakypixel.net](https://www.leakypixel.net/).

I'm an individual lucky enough to be paid to do what I love - ranging from React consultancy and training to bespoke web services, media screen systems and linux server configuration/management. 

I've been solving problems with tech for around 10 years and I'm still as eager as ever to push my skills and learn new things. I specialise in JavaScript (both front and back end) and have a penchant for getting the best performance out of applications, workflows and people.

## Experience

### The Co-op Group - JavaScript consultant

As part of the ventures team, built a new marketplace application using react
for the frontend and python with flask for the backend. Worked in a team of 2 to
get the project off the ground and into production.


### Life's Great - JavaScript consultant
*2018, 3 month contract, renewed twice for a total of 6 months*

Training a 10-person team with no prior experience on react/redux/webpack, building and architecture of the front-end react app, which presented questions with complex dependencies in a conditional manner. CI integration and optimisation of javascript code as well as various devops related tasks, such as docker scripts.


### Tyres on the Drive - JavaScript consultant
*2017, 3 month contract, renewed 4 times for a total of 12 months*

Rebuilding the front end react app using react and redux, training the team on react, building CI/deployment pipelines and assisting moving from a monolithic to micorservices-based architecture, as well as various small internal projects and assisting with day-to-day running of the tech team.


### The Hut Group - JavaScript developer
*2016, 3 month contract, renewed 4 times for a total of 12 months*

Worked on both internal and external projects, including:

-   Implementation of githook-based commit quality checking across the core platform

-   Componentisation of an existing codebase

-   Full site builds for external clients

-   NodeJS-based CMS APIs

-   Rework and performance improvements of an existing site

-   Integration of CMS into existing site

-   Development of a custom CMS in Angular 2

### Bet365 - JavaScript developer
*2015, 6 month contract*

Helping rebuild the front end of the Bet365 site in HTML5, CSS and TypeScript. In particular, I contributed to the build system, including linting, autoformatting and code style checking. Using the build system, we were able to greatly cut down time spent in code reviews and reduce the number of bugs making it through to testing. 


### On The Beach ltd. - Front end developer
*2013 - 2015, permanent*

Working on a travel search and booking website visited by thousands of people all over the UK on a daily basis, plus foreign-marketed versions of the same functionality. I was the first member of the front end team at On The Beach ltd., and during my 2 years there, I helped bring about many changes in the way that the front end of the sites were handled - such as strict coding guidelines and a componentisation of our legacy SCSS, HTML/ERB and JavaScript. In order to improve the quality of our JavaScript code, we used Jasmine to write unit tests along with Cucumber to describe features. 


## I'm not boring

I have quite a few hobbies outside of my development work, and try to keep myself as active as I can - especially during the summer, when I can get outside. 

-   Rock climbing and bouldering are my big hobbies... though they  don't look a lot different from the outside, there's quite a  gap. I vary between the two, but practice indoors twice a week and  get outside when I can. 

-   Somehow I ended up being a Scout leader, too. I was part of the  organisation when I was younger, and after a couple of years  break, I went back to help out. It has greatly helped me in  maintaining leadership skills, and organising larger groups of  people. 

-   I also spend quite a lot of my free time tinkering and working on  personal projects, such as building raspberry pi based camera  systems, monitors, or arcade systems - sometimes as paid work, sometimes  just for fun. 

-   To keep up with the fast-paced world of development, I spend quite a  lot of my free time reading, or listening to podcasts. Some of my  favourites are 99 percent invisible, late night linux, coder radio  and project bouldering.
